 ### [Exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security))

 An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to oneâ€™s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack.

 ### [Vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing))

In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to cross privilege boundaries (i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface.  
Vulnerabilities are classified according to the asset class they are related to:
- hardware
  - susceptibility to humidity or dust
  - susceptibility to unprotected storage
  - age-based wear that causes failure
  - over-heating
- software
  - insufficient testing
  - insecure coding
  - lack of audit trail
  - design flaw
- network
  - unprotected communication lines (e.g. lack of cryptography)
  - insecure network architecture
- personnel
  - inadequate recruiting process
  - inadequate security awareness
  - insider threat
- physical site
  - area subject to natural disasters (e.g. flood, earthquake)
  - interruption to power source
- organizational
  - lack of regular audits
  - lack of continuity plans
  - lack of security

### [CIA triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Key_concepts)

__Confidentiality__  
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."[36] While similar to "privacy," the two words aren't interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.[37]

__Integrity__  
In IT security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.  
More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.

__Availability__  
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.  
In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response, and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the CIA triad to be provided effectively.

Non-repudiation
In law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.
